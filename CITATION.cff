  Beaches the world over are under threat from sea level
  rise. The concept of living shorelines as a way to restore
  the protective power of beaches and dunes is gaining
  traction in many coastal areas, but managers need to know
  more about how plant species work with sand to create
  dunes. Ground sampling is time-consuming and custom remote
  sensing flights are expensive. Using a site in California
  as an example, Iâ€™ll explore ways to leverage open
  elevation data (lidar & DEMs) and open source software (R
  & QGIS) to better understand how plants build dunes. This
  workflow is applicable to ecosystems where topography
  plays an important role in understanding ecological
  interactions, such as riparian or lakeshore plant
  communities.
