# Beach & Dune Remote Sensing

Ground sampling on beaches is time-consuming and custom remote sensing flights are expensive. I’ll explore ways to leverage open elevation data (lidar & DEMs) and open source software (R & QGIS) to better understand how plants build dunes.

Beaches the world over are under threat from sea level rise. The concept of living shorelines as a way to restore the protective power of beaches and dunes is gaining traction in many coastal areas, but managers need to know more about how plant species work with sand to create dunes. Using Sands Beach at [Coal Oil Point Reserve](https://copr.nrs.ucsb.edu/) near Santa Barbara,California, as a case study, I’ll explore ways to leverage open elevation data (lidar & DEMs) and open source software (R & QGIS) to better understand how plants build dunes. 

This workflow is applicable to ecosystems where topography plays an important role in understanding ecological interactions, such as riparian or lakeshore plant communities.

## Data

### Imagery & Elevation Data

Because beach ecosystems change daily, having simultaneous imagery and elevation data is the best option. However, this is difficult to arrange, especially in retrospect. Elevation datasets from the summer months when California beaches are most stable in their width is difficult to come by. I was very lucky to find a lidar and DEM dataset from the 2018 wildfires in Santa Barbara that also coincided with imagery from two freely available sources - **Sentinel 2** and **Planet** (through their Education & Research License) - on a beach I am very familiar with through previous research.

### Species Observation Data

I am exploring the utility of publicly available species observation data through platforms like iNaturalist for validating plant pixels.
